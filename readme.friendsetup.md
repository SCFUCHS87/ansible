### üêß Distro Compatibility (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch)

This setup is now compatible with:

| Distro         | Status  | Notes                                         |
|----------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu 22.04+  | ‚úÖ Works | Fully tested with the Docker install script   |
| Debian 12+     | ‚úÖ Works | Fully tested with the Docker install script   |
| Fedora 38+     | ‚úÖ Works | Uses native `dnf` to install Docker           |
| Arch Linux     | ‚úÖ Works | Uses native `pacman` to install Docker        |

Docker will be installed automatically using the appropriate method for your distro:
- Ubuntu/Debian: via Docker's official install script
- Fedora: via `dnf install docker docker-compose`
- Arch: via `pacman -S docker`

The playbook will also enable and start the Docker service.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Arch and Fedora Users

- Ensure your user is in the `docker` group after install:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
Then log out and back in, or newgrp docker.

If Ansible cannot manage Docker post-install, you may need to reboot or manually start Docker with:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
